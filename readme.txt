This project contains one main program with many components.
The command 'make all' will compile the entire project. Alternatively, you
may compile according to the directions below.

---keygen---
To compile: make keygen
To run: ./keygen <Prime Number> <Prime Number> <PublicKey File> <PrivateKey File>
Description:
The keygen program generates RSA keys that will be used when encrypting and decrypting the desired texts. The RSA keys are generated by getting the two prime numbers provided as command-line arguments, and then placing them in the PublicKey File and PrivateKey Files created, respectively.
Known issues:
-None that I know of.

---encrypt---
To compile: make encrypt
To run: ./encrypt <PublicKey File> <PlainText File> <Encrypted File>
Description:
The encrypt program takes the PublicKey File and read the two keys required.Encrypt then reads the PlainText File. As the PlainText is read one character at a time, each character is encrypted and written on to the Encrypted File created.
Known issues:
-None that I know of.

---decrypt---
To compile: make decrypt
To run: ./decrypt <PrivateKey File> <Encrypted File> <Decrypted File>
Description:
The decrypt program takes the PrivateKey File and read the two keys required.Decrypt then reads the Encrypted File. As the Encrypted File text is read one numbe at a time, each number is decrypted and written on to the Decrypted File created (Original Text).
Known issues:
-None that I know of.
